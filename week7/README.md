## Exercise 1.3 Answers:

The PCA plot does not look entirely correct. Although a few tissue types- such as A2.3 and P2.4-cluster together clearly, many others show considerable overlap. In particular, Fe, LFC.Fe are not well separated, suggesting that PC1 and PC2 do not fully capture the sources of biological variation in the dataset. But note this could reflect true biological similarity among these tissues, but may also indicate that important variance is represented in higher-order PCs. Distinct populations of highly variable genes are localized to specific tissues.


It looks like one of the replicates data was swapped between Fe and LFC.Fe.

PC1 appears to reflect the anatomical position along the anteriorâ€“posterior axis. Referring back to the experimental schematic, the midgut samples were dissected in spatial order. This same positional gradient is observed along PC1 with A groups more negative and P groups more postitive. Thus, PC1 captures spatial organization of the gut epithelium.


## Exercise 3 Answers
Top 3 hits of GO for cluster 1 are L-Argenine biosynthesis, angiotensin maturation, and fatty acid beta oxidation. All of these 
Top 3 hits of GO for cluster 11 are fatty acid oxidation, fatty acid catabolic processes and lipid transport. 

These enrichments are consistent with the origin of the samples from Drosophila midgut, which is specialized for metabolic processing of dietary components. Fatty-acid catabolism and lipid transport are central metabolic functions of cells within the gut and thus enrichment of these pathways suggests that both clusters contain populations engaged in lipid breakdown and handling.

Although both clusters share enrichment for lipid metabolism, cluster 1 shows additional specificity for amino-acid biosynthesis pathways, including L-arginine production. This distinction suggests that different sub-regions or cell populations within the gut may specialize in processing distinct nutrient classes, reflecting functional compartmentalization along the digestive tract.
